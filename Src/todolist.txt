1)add an exceptions for situations the monster is stronger than the character,
  or we look for another character to try defeat the monster.

2)add an option that many characters(threads) hit the same monster and split the EXP - make it thread safe!

3)add an option that character that fight stronger monster eventually will die, and the HP of the monster
  stays as it was (if he hit it a bit).to demonstrate a fight, than if the character dies, another gets
  chance to play.  

4)think about ways to make this project be threaded, also use more things from REALITY.
